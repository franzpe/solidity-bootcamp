# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

# NFTs
Attributes (head, chest, legs, and weapon) NFTs are autogenerated, uploaded and pinned using NFT.storage API.
Run the following:
`yarn run ts-node scripts/NFTStorage/NFTstorage.ts`
Note: this requires NFT_STORAGE_KEY definition in .env.
The script does the following:
- envokes `scripts/NFTStorage/PrintOnImage.ts` which auto generates files for each attribute, using specifed range (currently set to 10 items per attribute) with an NFT number and Disclaimer printed on each attribute's base.jpg (stored as scripts/NFTStorage/images/attribute_name/base.jpg). Note: that the files are not saved but instead are kept in Buffer to avoid memory space usage.
- a set of all image files for each attribute is then sent to NFT.Storage as a "directory" (not actual directory, but files kept in buffer), which generates a CID for the directory followed by a file name (i.e., `ipfs://CID/iamge_file_id_in_the_range_from_1_to_10.jpg`)
- then metadata files (json files) are generated for each image file and kept in `scripts/NFTStorage/metadata/attribute_name`, the following is metadata format:
{
    "name": "NFT - " + attrName,
    "description": attrName + " is a part of " + attr + " NFT collection with randomly generate strength parameter",
    "image": "ipfs://"+CIDdir+"/"+String(ids[i])+".jpg",
    "strength": String(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)),
}
"image" field can be used to get access to stored file using IPFS
- a set of all metadata files for each attribute is then sent to NFT.Storage as a "directory" (not actual directory, but files kept in buffer), which generates a CID for the directory followed by attribute name and a file name (i.e., `ipfs://CID/attribute_name/json_file_id_in_the_range_from_1_to_10`)

## Printing Disclaimer on downloaded images, also helps to get unique CID (in case an image has been already been used on IPFS)
`yarn run ts-node scripts/NFTStorage/PrintOnImages.ts`
